Response bias occurs when the way researchers word a question distorts the answer. Nonresponse bias occurs when some members of a sample are inherently more likely to provide information than other members of the same sample. Selection bias occurs when the method of data collection systematically excludes certain members of the sample.
当研究人员提出问题的方式扭曲了答案时，就会出现反应偏差。当一个样本的某些成员天生比同一样本的其他成员更有可能提供信息时，就会出现无响应偏差。当数据收集方法系统地排除了样本中的某些成员时，就会出现选择偏差。

Model inputs are independent variables, which are variables that influence the behavior of other variables. Output variables are considered dependent variables because they react to outside influences. In particular, dependent variables react to changes in independent variables. A point estimate is an estimated result that is assigned a single value, whereas a range estimate is a result that includes possible values within specified limits.

The primary advantage of TQM is that it provides a gradual way for companies to improve the quality of their operations, products, and services. Its focus is incremental change and continuous improvement rather than radical change. Business process engineering (BPR) undertakes efforts to fundamentally redesign an organization’s business processes.
全面质量管理的主要优点是，它为公司提供了一种渐进的方法来提高其运营、产品和服务的质量。它的重点是渐进式的改变和持续的改进，而不是彻底的改变。业务流程工程（BPR）致力于从根本上重新设计组织的业务流程。
